# trafficSimulator

This is heavily based on the project by BillHim, but modified for other purposes. Rather than a visual simulation, we are looking for correlation between flow and density, through numerical stochastic analysis and graphing. That is, the objective of this project is different from the original, but the tools provided serve for our purpose with a new implementation we are offering.
